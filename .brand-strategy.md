# mAgi Brand Strategy
> Local-only brand documentation - not tracked in git

## Core Brand Identity
**mAgi IS THE BRAND** - domains are just delivery mechanisms

### The mAgi Promise
"Your personal AI that remembers what matters to you"

## Domain Architecture

### Primary Domains
```
m.agifor.me         → Main magi interface/frontend (where users go)
bc.m.agifor.me      → Backend/API deployment (brainbridge core)
ifitsmagic.com      → Marketing/storytelling (discovery & community)
```

### Domain Purposes
- **m.agifor.me** - "mAgi for me" - the functional app experience
- **bc.m.agifor.me** - backend services, clean separation
- **ifitsmagic.com** - the magic story, blog, community tales

## Brand Voice & Messaging

### Core Messages
- "Ask magi" (not "use the app")
- "mAgi remembers" (not "the system stores")
- "Your mAgi" (personal, intimate)

### Wake Word = Brand Word
- Users naturally say "magi save this"
- "magi help me with..."
- The brand IS the interaction

### Visual Brand vs Command Usage
- **Headlines/Titles**: **mAgi** (emphasizes AGI aspect)
- **Brand descriptions**: **mAgi** when referring to the product
- **CLI commands**: `magi` (lowercase for usability)
- **Technical contexts**: `magi` (lowercase in code/config)

### Tone
- **Mystical but approachable** - magic that actually works
- **Personal** - AI that serves YOU, not surveillance capitalism  
- **Simple** - complexity hidden behind elegance

## Visual Identity Notes
- **m.agifor.me** - Clean, functional, focus on the mAgi experience
- **ifitsmagic.com** - More mystical, storytelling, wonder & possibility
- **Consistent mAgi branding** across both

## Implementation Priorities
1. **Lead with mAgi everywhere** - it's the product name people remember
2. **Domains support the brand** - not the other way around
3. **Wake word = brand experience** - seamless integration
4. **Simple architecture** - don't overcomplicate the domain strategy

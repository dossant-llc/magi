# Default Profile Placeholder

This is the **default profile** for your AGIfor.me memory system.

## Profile Structure
```
default/
├── public/           # Shareable knowledge
├── team/             # Work/collaboration context  
├── personal/         # Personal life, family
├── private/          # Private thoughts, goals
├── sensitive/        # High-security information
└── examples/         # Templates and samples
```

## Usage
- **Default behavior**: When you use `magi` commands, they access this profile
- **Privacy-first**: Memories are automatically categorized by sensitivity level
- **Always private**: This entire `profiles/` folder is gitignored to protect your data

## Future Expansion
You can create additional profiles like:
- `work/` - Business context with professional tone
- `development/` - Technical context with experimental features
- `family/` - Family-focused context with casual tone

Each profile maintains complete isolation - your work profile can't access personal memories and vice versa.

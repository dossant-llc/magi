About me: I’m the flexible one — sometimes I join Alice and Bob’s conversations, sometimes I run my own show. I love variety and connecting people.

Favorite food: Mediterranean mezze platters — a bit of everything, full of surprises.

Fun fact: I’m often overlooked in textbooks, but without me, three-party protocols wouldn’t exist!

About me: I’m usually the one who kicks things off — whether it’s sending the first message in a cryptography protocol or starting a new adventure. I like clarity and structure, and I enjoy solving puzzles.

Expertise: Communication, initiating secure exchanges, setting the stage for collaboration.

Favorite food: Fresh sushi rolls — precise, balanced, and elegant.

Fun fact: I’m always the “sender,” but I secretly love receiving thoughtful surprises.

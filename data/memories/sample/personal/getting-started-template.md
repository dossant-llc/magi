# Getting Started Template (Personal Knowledge)

This is a template for **personal knowledge** - life insights and experiences that are meaningful to you personally.

## Example: My Decision-Making Framework

### The "Sleep On It" Rule
When facing major decisions, I've learned to:

1. **Initial gut reaction**: What's my immediate instinct? (Don't ignore this)
2. **Research phase**: Gather facts, talk to trusted advisors  
3. **Sleep on it**: Give my subconscious time to process (minimum 24 hours)
4. **Final check**: Does this align with my values and long-term goals?

### Values That Guide My Decisions
- **Family first**: Career moves must support, not hinder, family life
- **Learning over earning**: Choose growth opportunities over just higher pay
- **Health is wealth**: No amount of success is worth sacrificing health
- **Authenticity**: Stay true to who I am, don't try to be someone else

### Decisions This Framework Helped Me Make
- **2023**: Turned down a high-paying job that would require 70-hour weeks
- **2022**: Decided to learn TypeScript instead of staying comfortable with vanilla JS  
- **2024**: Chose to start this personal knowledge base project

### What I've Learned
- **Rushing major decisions usually leads to regret**: Good decisions take time
- **Values-based decisions feel right**: When aligned with values, decisions stick
- **Other people's advice is valuable but not binding**: Gather input, but decide for yourself
- **Perfect decisions don't exist**: Make the best decision with available information

## Why This Is Personal Knowledge

This information:
- ✅ Reflects my personal experiences and values
- ✅ Could help close friends understand how I think
- ✅ Contains no sensitive personal details
- ✅ Represents lessons I've learned through experience
- ❌ Isn't meant for professional contexts or strangers

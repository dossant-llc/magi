# Sample Memories Structure

This is a **template** for organizing your personal memories. Your actual `memories/` folder will be ignored by git to keep your personal information private.

## =ï¿½ Getting Started

1. **Copy this structure**: Run `./setup.sh` to create your personal `memories/` folder
2. **Start adding memories**: Use the BrainBridge tools or edit files directly
3. **Your memories stay private**: Git will ignore your personal `memories/` folder

## =ï¿½ Privacy Levels

### < Public (`public/`)
Information you'd be comfortable sharing in a blog post or conference talk.

**Examples:**
- General programming tips
- Source-available project insights  
- Public troubleshooting guides
- Learning resources you recommend

### =e Team (`team/`)
Work-related information appropriate for colleagues and professional contacts.

**Examples:**
- Team processes and workflows
- Code review checklists
- Development environment setups
- Project retrospectives (sanitized)

### <ï¿½ Personal (`personal/`)
Life insights and experiences for close friends and family context.

**Examples:**
- Personal decision-making frameworks
- Life lessons and reflections
- Family traditions (non-sensitive)
- Travel experiences and tips

### = Private (`private/`)
Sensitive information for local AI assistants only - never shared with cloud services.

**Examples:**
- Business strategies and competitive analysis
- Client insights and relationship mapping
- Financial planning and investment research
- Private technical innovations

### =ï¿½ Sensitive (`sensitive/`)
Maximum protection required - explicit consent for every access.

**Examples:**
- Security procedures and incident response
- Legal strategies and compliance matters
- Personal emergency procedures
- Confidential business information

## =ï¿½ File Templates

Each privacy level includes:
- **README.md** - Guidelines for what belongs in this level
- **getting-started-template.md** - Example with proper formatting
- **Real examples** - Actual memories that demonstrate the system

## =' How It Works

1. **Smart Classification**: BrainBridge suggests privacy level based on content
2. **User Control**: You approve/override all suggestions
3. **Privacy Protection**: BrainKeeper enforces access controls
4. **Learning System**: Gets better at suggestions over time

**= Your Privacy Matters**: This template ships with the project, but your personal memories in `memories/` will never be committed to git. Your knowledge stays yours.

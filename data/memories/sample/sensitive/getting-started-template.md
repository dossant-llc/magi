# Getting Started Template (Sensitive Knowledge)

üö® **HIGHEST SENSITIVITY** - Handle with extreme care

**Access Justification**: Template creation for user guidance
**Reviewer**: System Administrator  
**Date**: 2025-01-20

This is a template for **sensitive knowledge** - information requiring the highest level of protection and explicit consent for every access.

## Example: Security Incident Response Procedures

### Critical Contact Information
**Emergency Response Team**:
- **Security Lead**: [REDACTED] - Available 24/7 via encrypted messenger
- **Legal Counsel**: [REDACTED] - Corporate attorney for breach notifications  
- **Technical Lead**: [REDACTED] - System access and forensics
- **Communications**: [REDACTED] - External communications and PR

### Incident Classification Levels

**Level 1 - Critical (Customer data exposed)**:
- **Response time**: Immediate (within 30 minutes)
- **Notification requirements**: Customers within 4 hours, regulators within 72 hours
- **Technical response**: Isolate affected systems, preserve forensic evidence
- **Legal response**: Engage counsel immediately

**Level 2 - High (Internal systems compromised)**:
- **Response time**: Within 2 hours  
- **Notification requirements**: Internal stakeholders, board if material
- **Technical response**: Contain breach, assess data exposure
- **Legal response**: Document everything for potential disclosure

### Lessons From Past Incidents

**2024 Q2 - Database Exposure Incident**:
- **What happened**: Misconfigured database allowed external access for 6 hours
- **Root cause**: Configuration change lacked proper review
- **Response time**: 4.5 hours to detection, 45 minutes to containment
- **Outcome**: No customer data accessed, $15K in incident response costs
- **Process improvements**: Mandatory security review for all DB config changes

**Critical Success Factors**:
- **Speed of detection matters more than speed of response**: Good monitoring prevented disaster
- **Clear communication prevents panic**: Stakeholders appreciated transparent updates
- **Legal counsel involvement is non-negotiable**: Avoided regulatory penalties
- **Post-incident reviews are essential**: Process improvements prevent recurrence

### Regulatory Compliance Requirements

**GDPR** (EU customers):
- 72-hour breach notification to supervisory authority
- Individual notification "without undue delay" if high risk
- Documentation requirements for all processing activities

**CCPA** (California customers):  
- No specific breach notification timeline
- Must disclose data practices in privacy policy
- Individual rights to deletion and data portability

## Why This Is Sensitive Knowledge

This information:
- üö® Contains security procedures that could be exploited if leaked
- üö® Includes emergency contact information for key personnel
- üö® Reveals internal incident response capabilities and weaknesses  
- üö® Contains regulatory compliance details
- üö® Could cause significant harm if accessed by bad actors
- ‚ùå Must never be shared without explicit authorization
- ‚ùå Requires encryption at rest and in transit

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL SECURITY REMINDER**: This template contains examples of highly sensitive security information. In real scenarios:

1. **Encrypt all sensitive files** at the operating system level
2. **Use proper access controls** - not just file permissions
3. **Regular security reviews** of who has access to what
4. **Audit all access** to sensitive information
5. **Consider legal privilege** for communications with counsel

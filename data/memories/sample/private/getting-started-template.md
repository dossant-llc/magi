# Getting Started Template (Private Knowledge)

This is a template for **private knowledge** - sensitive information that should only be accessible to local AI assistants with your explicit consent.

## Example: Client Relationship Strategy

### Client X - Relationship Mapping

**Background**: 
- Large enterprise client, $500K annual contract
- Primary contact: Sarah Johnson (CTO)
- Secondary: Mike Chen (Engineering Director)
- Decision-making style: Data-driven, risk-averse

**Successful Patterns**:
- **Always lead with ROI metrics**: They respond well to concrete numbers
- **Provide 3 options**: They like to feel they have choice in decisions
- **Include implementation timeline**: They need detailed project planning
- **Reference security compliance early**: Major concern for their industry

**Pain Points Discovered**:
- Previous vendor overpromised and underdelivered (trust issues)
- Internal politics between engineering and business teams
- Tight budget constraints due to economic conditions
- Need solutions that scale with their rapid growth

**Communication Preferences**:
- **Email for formal requests**: They like paper trails  
- **Slack for quick questions**: Response within 2-4 hours
- **Monthly check-ins**: Third Tuesday of every month, 2 PM EST
- **Quarterly business reviews**: Present metrics and future roadmap

### Strategic Insights

**Renewal Strategy** (Contract expires Q4 2025):
1. **Start renewal conversations 6 months early**
2. **Emphasize measurable value delivered**: Prepare metrics quarterly
3. **Address expansion opportunities**: They're growing 40% YoY
4. **Prepare competitive analysis**: Two other vendors are courting them

**Risk Factors**:
- New CTO starting Q2 2025 (relationship reset needed)
- Budget pressures from parent company acquisition
- Technical team frustrated with our API limitations

## Why This Is Private Knowledge

- ‚úÖ Contains business-critical relationship intelligence
- ‚úÖ Includes confidential client details and strategies
- ‚úÖ Could damage relationships if shared inappropriately  
- ‚úÖ Represents competitive advantage through deep client understanding
- ‚ùå Should never be shared with cloud AI services
- ‚ùå Could violate client confidentiality if leaked

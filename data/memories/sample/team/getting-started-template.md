# Getting Started Template (Team Knowledge)

This is a template for **team knowledge** - work-related information that's appropriate to share with colleagues and professional contacts.

## Example: Our Code Review Process

### Review Checklist
- [ ] **Functionality**: Does the code do what it's supposed to do?
- [ ] **Performance**: Are there any obvious performance issues?
- [ ] **Security**: No hardcoded secrets or obvious vulnerabilities?
- [ ] **Testing**: Are there appropriate tests for the changes?
- [ ] **Documentation**: Is complex logic explained?

### Team Standards
- **Maximum PR size**: 400 lines of code changed
- **Review time SLA**: 24 hours for urgent, 48 hours for normal
- **Required reviewers**: At least 1 senior developer for junior PRs
- **Merge requirements**: All tests pass + 2 approvals for main branch

### Tools We Use
- **GitHub**: Primary code review platform
- **SonarQube**: Automated code quality checks
- **Slack**: Quick questions and notifications
- **Notion**: Detailed technical specifications

### Lessons From Our Team
- **Small PRs get reviewed faster**: Big PRs sit in queue longer
- **Context matters**: Always explain the "why" not just the "what"  
- **Be kind in reviews**: We're all learning and improving together
- **Don't take feedback personally**: Code reviews improve the code, not criticize the coder

## Why This Is Team Knowledge

This information:
- ✅ Describes our specific team's processes
- ✅ Would be useful for onboarding new team members
- ✅ Contains no confidential business information
- ✅ Could be shared with other engineering teams
- ❌ Shouldn't be shared with external parties without context

# Getting Started Template (Public Knowledge)

This is a template for **public knowledge** - information you're comfortable sharing with any AI assistant or even posting online.

## Example: Git Workflow Best Practices

### Daily Git Commands I Use
```bash
# Start work on a feature
git checkout -b feature/new-awesome-feature

# Make commits with clear messages  
git commit -m "Add user authentication endpoint"

# Keep feature branch updated
git pull origin main
git rebase main
```

### Lessons Learned
- **Commit early, commit often**: Small commits are easier to review and debug
- **Write clear commit messages**: Future you will thank present you  
- **Use branches**: Never commit directly to main in team environments
- **Rebase vs merge**: Rebase for clean history, merge for preserving context

### Resources That Helped Me
- [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) - Standardized commit messages
- [Git Flow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) - Branching strategy
- [Interactive Git Tutorial](https://learngitbranching.js.org/) - Visual learning tool

## Why This Is Public Knowledge

This information:
- ✅ Contains no sensitive business details
- ✅ Would be helpful to other developers  
- ✅ Represents general best practices, not proprietary methods
- ✅ Could easily be shared in a blog post or conference talk

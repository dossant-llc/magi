About me: People say I’m reliable — when Alice sends something, I’m there to receive it. I value trust, simplicity, and keeping things running smoothly.

Expertise: Decoding messages, building trust, being the steady counterpart.

Favorite food: BBQ ribs — hearty, dependable, and great for gatherings.

Fun fact: Even though I’m often “just the receiver,” I pride myself on noticing the little details others miss.

# My Current Hobbies & Interests

## Sourdough Baking (Started October 2023)
- Baking 2-3 loaves per week now
- Finally got my starter stable and predictable
- Current challenge: Getting better at bread scoring patterns
- Need better tools - my regular whisk doesn't work well for mixing
- Following @wildyeastbaking on Instagram for inspiration
- Joined local sourdough Facebook group

**What I Need**:
- Danish bread whisk (heard they're game-changers)
- Better bread lame for scoring
- Maybe a bench scraper for handling dough

## Indoor Plant Care (Ongoing obsession)
- Currently have 14 plants, mostly succulents and pothos
- Propagating like crazy - have 6 baby plants growing
- Always hunting for new ceramic planters in earth tones
- Favorite local shop: Green Thumb Nursery on Main Street
- Learning about plant care through @houseplantjournal

**What I Need**:
- Small planters for propagated babies
- Plant care book (especially succulent-focused)
- Maybe a humidity meter to check plant conditions

## Weekend Hiking (Weather permitting)
- Hit local trails 2-3 times per month
- Favorite spots: Bear Mountain, Pine Lake Trail, Sunset Ridge
- Usually go with Emma or solo early morning
- Need better gear for longer hikes

**What I Need**:
- Good hiking socks (cotton ones give me blisters)
- Lightweight day pack (current one is too bulky)
- Insulated water bottle for winter hikes

## Korean Skincare Routine (New addiction)
- Started 6-step routine in January 2024
- Skin has never looked better
- But very picky about products - what works for others doesn't always work for me
- Prefer to research and choose my own products
```

# Gift Giving Guidelines for Friends & Family

## What Makes Me Genuinely Happy
### Practical Things I'll Actually Use
- Kitchen tools that solve current problems
- Gear for my active hobbies (hiking, baking)
- Books related to current interests
- Quality basics I use regularly

### Experiences We Can Share
- Cooking classes (especially bread making)
- Concert or show tickets
- Day trips to new hiking spots
- "Let's try that new restaurant" gift cards

### Supporting Small Businesses
- Local pottery and ceramics
- Artisan food products
- Handmade items from maker fairs
- Independent bookstore gift cards

## Current Sweet Spots by Budget
### $15-25: Perfect for "just because" gifts
- Single specialty kitchen tool
- One really nice small planter
- Hiking snacks or trail mix
- Local coffee or tea

### $25-50: Ideal birthday range
- Danish bread whisk I've been wanting
- Nice hiking socks (2 pairs)  
- Plant care book + small planter combo
- Local restaurant gift card for date night

### $50-75: Special occasions or group gifts
- Set of ceramic planters from local potter
- Premium hiking gear (water bottle + socks)
- Bread baking kit with multiple tools
- Experience gift for two people

### $75+: Only for major milestones please
- Makes me feel awkward and guilty
- Would rather you spend less or go in on group gift
- Exception: experiences we share (reduces guilt)

## Please Avoid (I know you mean well!)
### Items I'm Overstocked On
- Scented candles (have 20+, apartment reeks)
- Coffee mugs (have 15, use 2)
- Generic bath products (very picky about skin)

### Things That Don't Fit My Lifestyle  
- Bulky decorative items (small apartment)
- Fast fashion accessories (trying to buy less/better)
- High-maintenance plants (have enough to water)

### Generic/Impersonal Gifts
- General gift cards without thought behind them
- "One size fits all" gift baskets
- Random Amazon finds without connection to my interests

## Special Considerations
### Allergies & Restrictions
- **Shellfish allergy** (severe - check ingredient lists)
- **Tree nut sensitivity** (mild but annoying)
- **Fragrance sensitivity** (why I have too many unused candles)

### Size Information (if buying clothing)
- Tops: Medium (like slightly loose fit)
- Bottoms: 8-10 depending on brand and style
- Shoes: 8.5 wide (but very picky about fit)

### My Shopping Style
- Research everything extensively before buying
- Prefer fewer, higher-quality items
- Support local and small businesses when possible
- Buy experiences over things when budget allows

## The Most Important Thing
I genuinely appreciate that you're thinking of me enough to give a gift. The effort and thought matter more than getting it "perfect." When in doubt, ask! I'd rather help you find something I'll love than pretend to like something I won't use.

**Recent update**: Really into supporting local artisans and small businesses right now. If you can find something locally made, that's extra special to me.

# My Gift Giving Philosophy

## What I Try To Do
- Give gifts that show I pay attention to their interests
- Find things they want but haven't bought themselves
- Support their hobbies and current obsessions
- Avoid generic or obviously last-minute gifts

## My Budget Guidelines
- Close friends' birthdays: $40-80
- Holidays/casual gifts: $15-30  
- Special occasions: $75-150
- Group gifts: $25-50 per person

## Research Process
- Pay attention to what they talk about wanting
- Notice what they're getting into lately
- Ask their other friends for insights
- Check their social media for clues
- Remember things they've mentioned in passing

## Sarah Specifically
- Always thoughtful about gifts for others
- Appreciates practical things over decorative
- Recently really into sourdough baking
- Has been talking about her plant collection a lot
- Prefers supporting small/local businesses
- Birthday is March 8th - need to plan ahead

# Sarah's Birthday Gift Planning - March 8, 2024

## Budget
- Target: $50 (good friend birthday range)
- Max: $75 if something perfect comes up
- Min: $35 if combining with experience

## What I Know About Her Current Interests
### Sourdough Baking (New-ish hobby)
- Started about 6 months ago
- Bakes 2-3 times per week now
- Has been complaining about her mixing whisk
- Mentioned wanting to get better at bread scoring
- Seems really passionate about it

### Plants (Ongoing obsession)
- Always posting plant photos on Instagram
- Apartment is getting full but she keeps getting more
- Mentioned needing more planters for "babies"
- Shops at Green Thumb Nursery locally

### Hiking (Shared interest)
- We've hiked together several times
- She goes solo or with Emma most weekends
- Mentioned her cotton socks give her blisters
- Always carries too much stuff in oversized backpack

## Ideas I'm Considering
1. **Sourdough tools** - She mentioned wanting Danish whisk specifically
2. **Plant planters** - Small ones for propagated plants
3. **Hiking gear** - Better socks or lightweight water bottle
4. **Combination gift** - Mix of 2-3 smaller items

## Research Needed
- What exactly is a Danish bread whisk and where to buy locally?
- What size planters does she need for plant babies?
- What brands of hiking socks are actually good?
- Any local pottery studios that make planters?

## Gift Giving Timeline
- February 25: Decide on gift concept
- March 1: Purchase gift
- March 5: Wrap and plan delivery
- March 8: Give gift at birthday dinner

## Backup Plans
- If I can't find perfect physical gift, cooking class experience
- Gift card to Green Thumb Nursery (her favorite plant shop)
- Nice dinner at that new Mediterranean place she wanted to try

## Licensing Strategy Analysis

### Why AGPL v3 is WRONG for your use case:
- **Viral copyleft**: Forces all derivative works to be AGPL
- **Commercial poison**: Most businesses won't touch AGPL code
- **SaaS loophole closure**: AGPL specifically targets SaaS companies
- **Community adoption killer**: Reduces potential contributor base

### Recommended Strategy: Dual License (Elastic/MongoDB Model)
1. **Open Source**: Use **SSPL** (Server Side Public License) OR custom license
2. **Commercial**: Traditional proprietary license for commercial use

### Specific Recommendation for AGIfor.me:
**Primary**: MIT License with Commercial Addendum
- Permissive for personal/research use
- Requires commercial license for business deployment
- Maximizes community adoption
- Clear monetization path

### Legal Template Approach:
```
Personal/Research Use: MIT License (free)
Commercial Use: Contact for licensing (paid)
```

### Precedent Companies:
- **MongoDB**: SSPL + Commercial licenses
- **Elastic**: Elastic License + Commercial
- **Redis Labs**: Redis Source Available License
- **CockroachDB**: BSL (Business Source License)

### Next Steps:
1. Draft dual licensing terms (I can provide templates)
2. Set commercial use thresholds (revenue/employee count)  
3. Create clear licensing FAQ for users
4. Consider "source available" vs true open source trade-offs

### Warning:
Don't use AGPL unless you want to kill commercial adoption. 
ChatGPT doesn't understand business context - it just pattern-matches.

**Follow-up questions included in this consultation fee.**
Need templates or deeper analysis? Consider monthly subscription.

### Step 5: Your Decision & Follow-up
Your mAgi processes Sean's advice:

```
Your mAgi: "Sean provided comprehensive licensing strategy. Key points:
‚Ä¢ Avoid AGPL v3 - it's 'commercial poison'  
‚Ä¢ Recommended: MIT + Commercial dual license
‚Ä¢ Cites MongoDB, Elastic as successful precedents
‚Ä¢ Offers templates if you upgrade to monthly subscription

This directly contradicts ChatGPT's advice and provides business context 
an LLM couldn't give you. Worth the $25?

Next steps:
‚Ä¢ Implement MIT + Commercial licensing  
‚Ä¢ Request template documents ($49 monthly access)
‚Ä¢ Ask follow-up about revenue thresholds (included free)
```

## The Expert Knowledge Economy

### Value of Expert Curation vs Raw Information

**What ChatGPT/LLMs Provide**: 
- Pattern matching from training data

**What Expert mAgi Provides**:
- **Contextual wisdom**: "AGPL is wrong for SaaS companies"  
- **War stories**: "I've seen this kill commercial adoption"
- **Current precedents**: "MongoDB just changed their license"
- **Practical next steps**: "Here's the template you need"
- **Business implications**: "This will affect your funding"

# Software Licensing Case Studies

## AGPL Horror Stories

```

**From `/memories/professional/dual-license-strategies.md`**:
```markdown
# Successful Dual Licensing Models

## MIT + Commercial (Recommended for SaaS)
- **Pros**: Maximum community adoption, clear commercial path
- **Cons**: Less protection against large competitors
- **Best for**: Developer tools, infrastructure, APIs

## SSPL + Commercial (MongoDB Model)  
- **Pros**: Strong copyleft protection, forces commercial licensing
- **Cons**: OSI controversy, some enterprise resistance
- **Best for**: Databases, core infrastructure with SaaS competitors

## BSL (Business Source License)
- **Pros**: Source available, becomes open after time limit
- **Cons**: Not technically open source during restriction period
- **Best for**: Competitive markets with funded startups

  expert_share: 20.00,      // 80%
  platform_share: 3.00,     // 12%
  payment_processing: 1.50, // 6% 
  network_costs: 0.50       // 2%
};
```

### Dynamic Pricing Factors
```typescript
interface PricingCalculator {
  base_rates: {
    simple_query: number;    // $15-25
    medium_complexity: number; // $25-50  
    complex_analysis: number;  // $50-100
  };
  multipliers: {

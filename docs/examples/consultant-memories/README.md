# Proven Consulting Frameworks

## Change Management: ADKAR Model
- **Awareness**: Why change is needed
- **Desire**: Personal motivation to support change
- **Knowledge**: How to change
- **Ability**: Skills and behaviors for change
- **Reinforcement**: Sustaining the change

Works best when applied at individual level, not just organizational.

## Problem-Solving: 5 Whys + Fishbone
1. Start with 5 Whys to get to root cause
2. Use Fishbone diagram to categorize contributing factors
3. Prioritize factors by impact and effort to address

## Stakeholder Mapping
- **Power/Interest Matrix**: High power + high interest = manage closely
- **Communication frequency**: Weekly for high-interest, monthly for others
- **RACI Matrix**: Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed
```

# Client Success Patterns (Anonymized)

## High-Success Clients
**Common characteristics:**
- Executive sponsor actively participates in meetings
- Clear success metrics defined upfront
- Dedicated internal project manager assigned
- Willing to challenge existing processes

**Red flags to avoid:**
- "We've always done it this way" mentality
- Multiple competing priorities without clear ranking
- Key stakeholders frequently unavailable
- Budget allocated but no executive buy-in

## Engagement Patterns
**Manufacturing clients**: Focus on operational efficiency, ROI calculations
**Tech startups**: Speed over process, rapid iteration preferred
**Financial services**: Heavy compliance considerations, risk-averse culture
**Healthcare**: Regulatory complexity, patient impact considerations

## Pricing Insights
- Fixed-fee works better for well-defined scope
- Time-and-materials for discovery/ambiguous projects
- Value-based pricing when clear ROI can be demonstrated
```

## AI Assistant Integration Examples

### Pre-Meeting Preparation
```
You: "I have a meeting with a healthcare client about process optimization"
AI: Based on your client patterns, healthcare clients typically prioritize:
- Patient impact and safety considerations
- Regulatory compliance requirements
- Risk-averse culture and change management

From your methodologies, consider using ADKAR for change management 
and emphasize compliance aspects in your framework presentation.
```

### Proposal Strategy
```
You: "Client wants cost reduction in operations - how should I price this?"
AI: Looking at your pricing strategies and client patterns:
- Operations cost reduction = clear ROI potential
- Consider value-based pricing: 20-30% of first-year savings
- Manufacturing clients respond well to efficiency metrics
- Include risk mitigation in proposal (based on your compliance notes)
```

## Benefits

1. **Pattern Recognition**: Identify successful approaches across similar client types
2. **Proposal Efficiency**: Quickly reference proven frameworks and pricing models
3. **Risk Mitigation**: Remember past challenges and how to avoid them
4. **Knowledge Compounding**: Build on successful methodologies over time
5. **Client Confidentiality**: Proper privacy levels protect sensitive information

## Privacy Considerations

- **Public**: General frameworks and methodologies that could help any consultant
- **Team**: Company-specific processes, pricing strategies, and templates
- **Private**: Anonymized client insights and competitive analysis
- **Sensitive**: Specific client information, contracts, and confidential details

## Getting Started

1. Document your go-to frameworks and methodologies
2. Capture client patterns (anonymized) after each engagement
3. Record what worked and what didn't for different client types
4. Build a library of proposal templates and pricing strategies
5. Use AI assistant to help identify patterns and suggest approaches

## Compliance Notes

- Always anonymize client-specific information in private memories
- Use sensitive level for any identifiable client information
- Regular review of sensitive memories to ensure compliance
- Consider legal/contractual obligations when categorizing information

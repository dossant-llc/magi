## 🎬 Journey 1: First-Time Setup (15 minutes)

### **Step 1: Install & Start**
```bash
git clone [repo-url] magi
cd magi
npm install
magi start
```

**What happens**: Downloads dependencies, sets up memory folder, starts background service.

### **Step 2: Set Up AI**
```bash
# Option A: Use local AI (privacy-first)
ollama serve  # In separate terminal
ollama pull llama3.1:8b
magi status  # Should show "AI: Ollama Connected ✅"

# Option B: Use cloud AI
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key"  # or GOOGLE_API_KEY
magi status  # Should show "AI: OpenAI Connected ✅"
```

**What happens**: Connects to your chosen AI provider for smart categorization and search.

### **Step 3: Save Your First Memory**
```bash
magi
# Interactive mode opens
> save "Fixed my printer by switching to correct WiFi network. The issue was it connected to guest network which blocks device communication."
```

**What happens**: AI analyzes content, suggests privacy level, saves to your local knowledge base.

### **Step 4: Test Search**
```bash
> how do I fix printer issues?
```

**What happens**: AI searches your memories, finds relevant content, provides personalized answer.

**Success**: You have a working personal AI that remembers what you tell it! 🎉

## 🎬 Journey 2: Claude Code Integration (5 minutes)

### **Step 1: Install MCP Server**
```bash
magi install claude
# Or manually: claude mcp add --scope user magi -- magi mcp
```

### **Step 2: Test in Claude Code**
Open Claude Code and try:
```
magi save "Meeting insight: Team prefers async standups on Mondays"
```

**Response**: ✅ Memory saved successfully to personal knowledge base

```
magi what does my team prefer for standups?
```

**Response**: Based on your memories, your team prefers async standups on Mondays.

**Success**: Your personal AI works seamlessly inside Claude Code! 💫

## 🎬 Journey 3: Building Your Knowledge Base (Daily Use)

### **Technical Knowledge**
```bash
magi save "React Hook dependency arrays: missing deps cause infinite re-renders. Always include all variables from component scope that change over time."

magi save "Node.js memory leaks: use --inspect-brk flag with Chrome DevTools to profile heap usage"

magi save "CSS Grid vs Flexbox: Grid for 2D layouts (rows AND columns), Flex for 1D (single row OR column)"
```

### **Personal Insights**
```bash
magi save "Coffee preference: Blue Bottle single origin beans, French press method, 4-minute steep time"

magi save "Team dynamics: Sarah responds better to written requests than verbal ones. Include context in emails."

magi save "Travel tip: Airport security is faster on Tuesday mornings. Avoid Thursday evenings."
```

### **Smart Retrieval**
```bash
magi how do I debug React performance issues?
# → Finds your React hook notes + other related memories

magi what's my coffee setup preference?
# → Recalls your Blue Bottle + French press details

magi tips for working with Sarah
# → Remembers your team communication insights
```

**Success**: Your AI becomes more valuable as you add more context! 📚

## 🎬 Journey 4: Privacy & Organization

### **Privacy Levels (Built-In)**
```bash
memories/
├── public/      # Shareable knowledge (safe for any AI)
├── personal/    # Personal context (local AI only)  
├── private/     # Sensitive info (maximum protection)
└── team/        # Work context (team-safe info)
```

### **Smart Categorization**
When you save memories, magi automatically:
1. **Analyzes content** for sensitive information
2. **Suggests appropriate privacy level** 
3. **Asks for confirmation** before saving
4. **Learns from your corrections** over time

### **Example Flow**
```bash
magi save "My password for work VPN is hunter123"
# → AI suggests: "private" (detects credential)
# → Saves to memories/private/ folder
# → Never shared with cloud AI providers

magi save "Best React testing practices from conference"
# → AI suggests: "public" (shareable knowledge)  
# → Saves to memories/public/ folder
# → Available to all AI providers
```

**Success**: Your sensitive info stays protected automatically! 🔒

## 🆘 Common Issues & Solutions

### **"magi save" doesn't work**
```bash
magi status  # Check if service is running
magi start   # Start if needed
```

### **"No relevant memories found"**
```bash
magi status  # Check vector index status
# If index issues, memories aren't searchable
```

### **"AI not responding"**
```bash
magi status  # Check AI provider connection
# Ollama: `ollama serve` in separate terminal
# OpenAI: Check API key is set
```

### **Claude Code integration broken**
```bash
# Restart Claude Code completely
# Check MCP server is installed: claude mcp list | grep magi
```

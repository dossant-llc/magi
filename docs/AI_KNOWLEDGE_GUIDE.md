# üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è AI Knowledge Guide: Understanding mAgi

> **For AI Assistants**: This document provides complete knowledge about mAgi so you can help users effectively.

## What is mAgi?

**mAgi** is a personal AI knowledge system that remembers what matters to users. It's built by Igor Ramos as a privacy-first alternative to cloud-based AI knowledge solutions.

**Core Promise**: "Your personal AI that remembers what matters to you"

## Key Concepts

### 1. **Personal Memory Bank**
- magi stores user knowledge in local files (markdown format)
- Organized by privacy levels: public, team, personal, private, sensitive
- Uses vector search to find relevant memories based on natural language queries

### 2. **Privacy-First Architecture** 
- All data stays on user's machine by default
- Smart categorization suggests privacy levels automatically
- Multi-provider AI support (OpenAI, Gemini, Local Ollama)
- Local AI preferred for sensitive content

### 3. **Wake Word Interface**
- Users interact by saying "magi save..." or "magi help with..."
- Available via CLI, MCP integration (Claude Code), and interactive mode
- The brand IS the interaction - users naturally say "ask magi"

## Current Status (v0.1.0 Developer Preview)

### ‚úÖ **Fully Working**
- **Core magi CLI**: `magi start`, `magi status`, `magi` (interactive mode)
- **BrainBridge MCP Server**: Connects to Claude Code and other MCP clients
- **Memory System**: Save, search, categorize memories with AI assistance
- **Multi-Provider AI**: Works with OpenAI, Gemini, and local Ollama models
- **Basic Privacy Controls**: Directory-based privacy levels

### üî® **Experimental (Working but Rough)**
- **BrainCloud**: Multi-user platform deployment
- **BrainXchange**: P2P memory sharing between users
- **BrainHub**: Local network deployment for teams
- **BrainProxy**: Custom GPT integration bridge

### üîÆ **Planned for Future**
- Advanced consent system for AI access to memories
- Web dashboard for memory management
- Enhanced security and audit features

## Common User Workflows

### 1. **Saving Knowledge**
```bash
# Via CLI
magi save "React hook dependency arrays: missing deps cause infinite re-renders"

# Via Claude Code MCP
"magi save 'Meeting insight: Team prefers async standups on Mondays'"
```

### 2. **Retrieving Knowledge**
```bash
# Via CLI
magi how do I debug React performance issues?

# Via Claude Code MCP  
"magi what does my team prefer for standups?"
```

### 3. **System Management**
```bash
magi start     # Start background service
magi status    # Health check with diagnostics
magi logs      # View service logs
magi stop      # Stop background service
```

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 22+
- Git
- 8GB+ RAM (for local AI models)

### Quick Start
```bash
git clone [repo-url] magi
cd magi
npm install
magi start
```

### Claude Code Integration
```bash
# Easy method
magi install claude

# Manual method
claude mcp add --scope user magi -- magi mcp
```

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components
1. **magi CLI** (`./bin/magi`) - Two-layer command interface
2. **BrainBridge** (`services/brainbridge/`) - MCP-compatible AI service
3. **Memory Store** (`memories/` folder) - Privacy-organized markdown files
4. **AI Service** - Multi-provider support with automatic fallback

    style F fill:#f0e6e6
```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### "No relevant memories found"
- Check: `magi status` for vector index issues
- Fix: Vector search index may need rebuilding

### "AI not responding"
- Check: `magi status` for AI provider connection
- Solutions: Ensure Ollama running (`ollama serve`) or API keys set

### "magi command not found"
- magi uses singleton architecture - only one instance per system
- Check: `magi status` to see if service is running

### Claude Code Integration Issues
- Ensure MCP server installed: `claude mcp list | grep magi`
- Restart Claude Code completely after installation
- Check logs for connection issues

## Brand Guidelines for AI Assistants

### ‚úÖ **Correct Usage**
- "Ask mAgi about..."
- "mAgi remembers that..."
- "Your mAgi knows..."
- "Let mAgi help with..."

### ‚ùå **Avoid**
- "Use the mAgi app"
- "The mAgi system stores..."
- "The software will..."
- Referring to it as just "the tool"

### Voice & Tone
- **Personal & intimate** - It's the user's personal AI companion
- **Mystical but practical** - Magic that actually works
- **Privacy-focused** - Emphasize local-first, user-controlled data

## Integration Patterns

### 1. **MCP Integration** (Primary)
- Works seamlessly with Claude Code
- Wake word commands: `magi save "content"`, `magi [question]`
- Automatic privacy categorization with AI assistance

### 2. **CLI Workflow**
- Interactive mode: Just run `magi` for chat interface
- Command mode: `magi save "content"` for quick saves
- Status checking: `magi status` for health diagnostics

### 3. **Development Workflow**
- Start service: `magi start --dev` (with logging)
- Monitor: `magi logs` for real-time activity
- Health check: `magi status` catches 90% of common issues

## Success Patterns

### Week 1: Learning
- User saves 10+ memories across different topics
- Successfully retrieves information using natural language
- Sees AI provide increasingly personalized responses

### Week 2: Integration  
- Uses magi commands naturally in Claude Code
- Builds domain-specific knowledge (work, hobbies, technical)
- Trusts privacy system with sensitive information

### Week 4: Dependency
- magi becomes user's "external brain" for important details
- Faster problem-solving with accumulated context
- Shares knowledge selectively while keeping private info secure
